## About me
My name is Hanssel Morales. I'm a Civil Engineer turned a Data Analyst. I'm able to use Python (Jupiter Notebooks), SQL, Excel, and Tableau/Power BI to analyze data. I'm a analytical, goal-oriented, assertive person with technical and interpersonal skills to find solutions when needed. Also, I love facing new challenges and that is why I love analyzing data. You never get bored finding insights, making predictions, and showing them by telling an interesting story that captivates people's attention.

Since I really love data, I decided to move into the Data Analytics field.
