# Data Analytics Portfolio
This is my portfolio, which contains my Data Analysis Projects using Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.

## About me
My name is Hanssel Morales. I am a Civil Engineer turned Data Analyst. This journey started when, in my Civil Engineer position, I used to spend several hours analyzing Excel sheets to find ways to improve the operational performance of the company. I did that by analyzing indicators such as Conversation Rate and others that were related to construction projects. That led me to realize that I had a strong desire to always analyze data, deciding afterward to switch my career and become a Data Analyst. I can tell it was a decision I do not regret having taken at all. 


## My abilities
I can use Python (Jupiter Notebooks), SQL, Excel, and Tableau/Power BI to analyze data. I'm an analytical, goal-oriented, assertive person with technical and interpersonal skills to find solutions when needed. Also, I love facing new challenges, so I love analyzing data since doing it is facing new challenges every single day.
