# Data Analytics Portfolio
This is my portfolio, which contains my Data Analysis Projects using Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.

## About me
My name is Hanssel Morales and I am a Civil Engineer turned Data Analyst. While working as a Civil Engineer, I often spent hours analyzing Excel sheets to improve the operational performance of the company. I analyzed various indicators such as conversion rates and others related to construction projects. This made me realize my strong desire to always analyze data. As a result, I decided to switch my career and become a Data Analyst. I can confidently say that it was a decision I do not regret having taken. 


## My abilities
I am proficient in using Python (Jupyter Notebooks), SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to analyze data. I possess analytical skills, a goal-oriented mindset, and an assertive personality, along with strong technical and interpersonal skills required to find solutions when needed. I enjoy taking up new challenges, and analyzing data is one of my favorite activities, as it presents me with new challenges every day.
