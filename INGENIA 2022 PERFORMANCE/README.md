# INGENIA EDA
In this project, I explored data of a company called Ingenia. I was asked to find trends in the company's services-assignation behavior. It was a problem for the company the fact that they didn't have any information of why there were drastic variations in 2022 revenue.

Using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas, as well as Microsoft Excel, I cleaned, visualized and analyzed the data to perform various tasks. Given the existing conditions, I decided to analyze the trends of revenue per each 2022's quarter.

# INSIGHTS

1. We were parting from the point where we could see that the Revenue-per-Quarter had an up-and-down trend.

2. According to the following graphic, there was no correlation between Quantity of Requests and Revenue-per-Quarter.

3. The following graphic showed that the level of approved services followed the same trend as the level of requested services. One highlight of this graphic was that in the Q2-Q3 period, there was a high increment on requested services. However, that increment was too low on approved services.

4. This graphic below showed that VARGAS' approvals (revenue) followed the same trend as the one shown on the Revenue-per-Quarter graphic. VARGAS was likely the reason why the quarter revenue varies the way it's shown on the Revenue-per-Quarter graphic. That is, every quarter when VARGAS' approvals declined, Revenue-per-Quarter declined as well, and the other way around. This might explain the reason why the mentioned trend exists.

5. Regarding a Revenue-per-Type-of-Service analysis, we had opposite findings to the initial hypothesis. Type INFRA has been the most approved type of service. In addition, it follows the same trend as Revenue-per-Quarter's one. Also, Q1 didn't have any single TOWER service approved. In addition, TOWER-services approvals' revenue has been almost constant across Q2-Q3-Q4 quarters, which is different from the quarters' up-and-down-general-trend (considering INFRA-services).

6. This graphic confirmed that VARGAS is powerfully involved in the level of approvals the company has. An important point was that VARGAS were no longer approving INFRA services. So, in order to maintain an acceptable level of revenue, the company should look at the top-2-analyst, MARTÍNEZ.

## CONCLUSIONS
After having analyzed the data, the next conclusions were found:

1. INFRA was the type of service with the most revenue obtained.
2. INFRA’s quarters-trend is the same as Revenue-per-Quarter’s trend. Therefore, there’s solid evidence to aseverate that the more INFRA services approved, the better level of Revenue-per-Quarter obtained.
3. Vargas was likely the reason why the quarter revenue varies the way it's shown on the Revenue-per-Quarter graphic.
