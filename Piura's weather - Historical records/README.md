# Piura's weather - Historical records Project
This project was aimed to exploring the historical weather records of city of Piura, which is located in Peru. This city is known as one of the hottest cities in Peru so evaluating
the behavior of its historical records of temperature was an interesting challenge. To do that, I obtained the local weather records from SENAMHI, which is the official Peruvian source for
metheorological information; that data was in the form of a csv file. Afterwards, I converted that file into a SQL file using an external platform. Having already the csv file converted
into a SQL file, I proceeded to query it to find some relevant insights. To finish the project, I built a visualization containing the main findings of the analysis.

Some of the most relevant findings are next mentioned:


### 1. What is the max temperature ever registered?
The max temperature ever registered in Piura is 37.8 C째. That peak temperature was reached in two different dates during the last 50 years: 1988-2-28 and 1991-3-5.
