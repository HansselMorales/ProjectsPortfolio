# Ingenia Data Analysis (2023 Q1)
The goal of this project was to determine how the current company's performance is doing. In order to do that, a comparison between 2022's performance and the current one was made.
Results show that 2023 Q1's revenue has largely overcome 2022 Q1's revenue. In addition, a highlight of this conclusion is that the current performance has been achieved by running a strategy based on what was predicted by the analysis run last year.

### INSIGHTS

1. 2023's revenue has reached a 20% of 2022's total revenue.

### CONCLUSIONS
1. Since 2023 Q1's revenue has largely overcome 2022 Q1's revenue (2X), it's correct to affirm that the current performance is doing great.
2. 80%+ of 2023's revenue has been produced by the execution of Tower services.
3. 85%+ of 2023's revenue has been produced by the execution of Vargas' approved services, as determined in 2022's Analysis. Given that, the insights found last year have been determinant to predict which Analyst was the top priority.
