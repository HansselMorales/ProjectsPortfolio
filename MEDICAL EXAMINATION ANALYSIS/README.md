# MEDICAL EDA
In this project, I worked with medical examination data to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices. The dataset included information like age, height, weight, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking habits, alcohol intake, physical activity, and presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.

Using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas, I visualized and analyzed the data to perform various tasks, including creating charts to show the counts of good and bad outcomes for different variables, adding an overweight column to the data, normalizing the data, converting the data into long format and creating a chart that shows the value counts of the categorical features, cleaning the data by filtering out incorrect patient segments, and creating a correlation matrix using the dataset.
I also made sure to set any variable that was previously set to None to the correct code.


## INSIGHTS
Some of the insights that I found out while working on this project are:

1. The majority of patients in the dataset had normal cholesterol levels, normal glucose levels, did not smoke or drink alcohol, and were physically active.
2. Patients with cardiovascular disease had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher BMI, and were more likely to have higher cholesterol levels, higher glucose levels, and smoke cigarettes.
3. By creating a correlation matrix, I found that there was a positive correlation between age and blood pressure, as well as a positive correlation between BMI and blood pressure.
4. Cleaning the data by filtering out incorrect patient segments resulted in a smaller but more accurate dataset. It is important to carefully clean data before analyzing it to ensure that the insights gained are valid and reliable.
5. Normalizing the data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad helped to simplify the data and make it easier to interpret. It allowed me to focus on the relationships between different variables and how they contribute to good or bad outcomes.


## CONCLUSION
Overall, this project provides deeper understanding of the relationship between various factors and cardiovascular disease. The insights gained from analyzing the data can be used to develop better treatment and prevention strategies for individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease.
