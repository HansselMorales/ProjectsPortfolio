# Career Track Analysis with SQL and Tableau Project
This project aimed to exploring 365-Data-Science-Platform's Student Enrollments and Completions in Data-Related Career Track. To do that, I used SQL and Tableau Public platform.
The results are shown next:

### 1. What is the number of enrolled students monthly? Which is the month with the most enrollments? Speculate about the reason for the increased numbers.
By examining the height of the bars, we can see that enrollment fluctuates between 800 and 1,200 persons every month,with August recording a greater amount.
The cause is a three-day campaign that 365 conducted to grant free platform access to all of its students. It is evident that this has increased enrollment and, consequently, completion rates.
Nevertheless, it appears that the majority of those joined during this time began the course but stopped after the free days were gone.

### 2. Which career track do students enroll most in?
At the first place, we have the Data Analyst career track. Second, the Data Scientist career track. And, finally, the Bussines Analyst track.

### 3. How long does it typically take students to complete a career track? What type of subscription is most suitable for students who aim to complete a career track: monthly, quarterly, or annual?
One may argue that it takes a long time for students to finish a professional track, between 91 and 365 days. The second bar chart produced for the initiative, which shows that it requires students to pay an annual membership to finish a single career track, lends credence to this assertion.
