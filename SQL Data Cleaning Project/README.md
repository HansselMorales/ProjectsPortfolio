# SQL Data Cleaning Project
Data cleaning is a critical step in data analysis. This is because duplicate or null values can affect the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results. Therefore, it is mandatory to correct them 
to ensure that the conclusions we arrive at are both reliable and accurate. In this project, I used SQL Server to clean a Kaggle dataset. ETL was performed using the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard.
