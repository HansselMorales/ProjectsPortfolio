# A Meritocratic Remote Work Distribution with a Data-driven Approach
In today's dynamic work environment, identifying and rewarding high performers while fostering employee engagement is critical for organizational success. This case study delves into the development of a Power BI dashboard (in Spanish) for a client seeking to implement a merit-based system for allocating remote work days.


### The Challenge:
The client, a Spanish-speaking, Peruvian branch of a multinational German company with a hybrid work model, sought a transparent and objective method to distribute remote work privileges based on employee dedication.

### The Solution:
An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing key metrics, including:

#### Individual Employee Contribution:
Recognizing consistent commitment beyond the traditional workweek, the dashboard highlights employees with the highest total login durations on Saturdays throughout 2024.

#### Departmental Engagement Analysis:
Gaining deeper insights into work patterns, the dashboard reveals departments with the highest overall login times on Saturdays (e.g., Operaciones Impo).

#### Comparative Insights:
By offering individual and departmental perspectives, the dashboard provides a comprehensive understanding of employee engagement across various levels.

### The Results:

#### Data-driven Rewards:
By identifying employees exceeding the expectations of login durations on Saturdays, the client can acknowledge and reward their dedication with increased remote work opportunities such as more remote work weekdays.

#### Actionable Insights:
Departmental-level insights enable the client to identify areas for potential further engagement initiatives, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

#### Dynamic Framework:
The readily updatable dashboard empowers ongoing monitoring and analysis, allowing the client to assess the effectiveness of their meritocratic program and adapt as necessary.


### Conclusion:
This project underscores the transformative power of data-driven decision-making in the HR landscape. By leveraging powerful analytics, companies can create objective reward systems that motivate and empower their workforce, ultimately propelling organizational success in the hybrid work era.
