# A Civil Engineering Project Through Data's Lens ️
Data is more than just numbers – it's a powerful storytelling tool, especially in the world of civil engineering! In this project, I designed a dashboard that tracks the progress of a civil engineering project consisting of the maintenance of critical structures across multiple locations.
          
Here's a sneak peek at what the data reveals:


### Site Visits:
4 out of 9 projects, 2 per group, had a flurry of activity with 4 visits, being above the average number of visits. Nonetheless, the projected number of visits was only 2. It seems there are a few things to fix there.

### Reporting:
Reports are making their way to the client. Nonetheless, there was a global delay of 29 days against the projected time of delivery – could there be unforeseen challenges for the next upcoming project?

### Teams' Performance
The Group 2 (AVG reporting duration: 2.80 days) had a better performance than the Group 1 (AVG reporting duration: 6.25 days). This may have been due to the different approach Group 2's Supervisor had on their team. This could give an interesting approach to how to efficiently manage the teams so they can perform in the best way possible.

Data is just the first chapter. The real story lies in the analysis and what it tells us about the project's progress, challenges, and areas for improvement.

This dashboard is just a taste of how data can illuminate complex tracking of projects in civil engineering.
